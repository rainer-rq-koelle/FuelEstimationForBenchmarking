The aim is to develop\na data-driven approach based on the existing operational efficiency\nindicator methodologies.\nOverview\nAir transportation has grown over the past decades. Air traffic is\nprojected to recover from the unprecedented decrease in demand during\nthe COVID pandemic period, 2020-2021.\nAcross the globe, states have defined ambitious political goals to\naddress the impact of climate change. Accordingly, there is a higher\ninterest in monitoring/estimating the impact of operational\n(in)efficiency.\nOperational inefficiencies typically increase the aircraft flying\ntime (i.e. airborne and surface movement times) and , thus, engine\nrunning time. Engine time is directly linked to fuel burn and associated\nemissions and pollutants. In that respect, inefficiencies contribute to\nthe ditremental effect of excessive emissions to climate change.\nAircraft engines produce various types of emissions. These emissions\ninclude carbon dioxide CO2, water vapour H2O, nitrogen oxides nitrogen\noxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur\noxides (SOX), particulate matter (PM), and other trace compounds. About\n70 percent of aircraft emissions are CO2; followed by H2O atslightly\nless than 30% while the rest of the pollutant represent less than 1\npercent each [source]. CO2 and H2O form significant amount of GHG\nemissions that can trigger climate change while NOX, CO, HC, SOX and\nparticulate matter are always associated with air quality and\nsubsequently public health\nOperational performance benchmarking aims at understanding the\nsimilarities and differences of operational practices/concepts,\ntechnological enablers, and strategic and operational priorities in\ndifferent regions. The practice of operational performance benchmarking\nis well established through regular bi-regional (e.g. US/EU, BRA-EUR,\nCHN-EUR) or multi-regional (PWBG) comparison reports. These\nreports/groups build their joint work on harmonised practices and\njointly agreed methods. ICAO is promoting a performance-based approach\nand associated benchmarking. Through its Global Air Navigation Plan\n(GANP), ICAO proposes a set of performance indicators to measure\noperational performance. However, to date, this set of indicators does\nnot cater specifically for Environmental (Sustainability). As an initial\nstep, there is an intetest to develop tools/approaches for converting\noperational inefficiencies into additional fuel burn/\\(CO_2\\) emissions.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nTo measure operational inefficiencies, the ICAO GANP proposes a set\nof indicators:\nsurface movement phase: additional taxi-in and taxi-out time\napproach phase: additional time in terminal airspace\nThese indicators compare the observed (actual) movement duration,\ne.g. from off-block to take-off, with an associated reference time.\nReference times are calculated for flights with similar characteristics.\nFrom each sub-population the 20th percentile of the observed movement\ndurations is calculated as the reference time.\nNote: provide details to the algorithms.\nFrom an environmental perspective, fuel burn is directly linked to\nengine time. Accordingly, inefficiencies, i.e. additional times,\nrepresent excessive engine time (and associated fuel burn). Green-house\ngas emissions are a product of fuel burn. Thus estimating the fuel burn\nper flight phase or measured inefficiency allows to quantify the\nenvironmental impact.\nFuel burn estimation requires a mapping of engine and airframe. This\nmapping is further complicated by the fact that various aircraft of the\nsame family may be fitted with different engines. Accordingly, this work\nis not - yet - aiming to establish a “perfect” aircraft/engine mapping.\nThe associated mapping is based on representative engines (and based on\nopen data / resources).\nBenchmarking\nand Fuel Estimation in Arrival Phase\nuse ICAO Carbon Emission Calculator “data”\naerodrome pair estimation based on web-interface\nstage length based scaling\n\ndetermine “average” fuel burn for “average” flight during last\n100NM, and associate this fuel burn with the reference time\ncalculate\ntotal fuel burn during arrival phase\nexcessive fuel burn for additional time in terminal airspace\n\nBenchmarking\nand Fuel Estimation in Taxi-in and Taxi-Out Phase\n\nintroduce LTO and modelling assumptions –> “aircraft engine\nexhaust emissions … (Masiol and Harrison)”.\n\nICAO defined a default LTO cycle consisting of distinct phases:\ntakeoff, climb, approach, and taxi/ground idle. These phases are\ncharacterised with specified thrust levels and times-in-mode.\nFor our study we developed a lookup table for aircraft/representative\nengines and linked this to the ICAO Engine Databank (ICAO (n.d.)).\nFor taxi-in, we only apply the assumed 7% thrust setting of the\nEngine Databank. Note: this does not take into account reverse thrust\noperations to decelerate the aircraft during its landing roll.\nFor operational performance benchmarking the taxi-out measure is\ndetermined by deriving the taxi time as the difference between the\nactual off-block time (AOBT) and the actual take-off time (ATOT). This\nincludes the take-off roll. The ICAO LTO time-in-mode assume a 0.7min\n(=42 sec) take-off roll. From an operational perspective this is a\nreasonable assumption for the majority of commercial aircraft.\nNote: The take-off roll assumption needs to be adapted for piston and\nprivate aircraft operations (e.g. C172).\n\n\n\nICAO. n.d. “ICAO Engine Emissions Databank.”\n\n\n\n\n",

Air transportation accounts for about 2-3% of annual CO2\nemissions, however, the total amount of CO2 emissions constantly\nincreased pre-COVID.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual emissions by commercial aircraft 2004-2021\n\n\n\nFig 1 shows the total emissions of commercial flights\nas reported by IATA (IATA\n2019).\nLevers for fuel reduction:\noperational efficiency\nmarket-based measures\nsustainable aviation fuel\nnew aircraft propulsion and airframes\nA wider use and pick-up of sustainable aviation fuel, and new\naircraft propulsion technologies or aircraft design requires further\nresearch. Despite the introduction of an initial market-based mechanism,\nimmediate action to curb fuel burn and CO2 emissions rests with\nimprovements of operational efficiency.\nICAO promotes a performance-based approach. The Global Air Navigation\nPlan (GANP) proposes indicators for regional benchmarking (ICAO\n2019). However, there is no detailed guidance on how to\nmeasure additional fuel burn.\nFuel burn per se is known to the aircraft operator. While the actual\nfuel burn and fuel flow during the flight is recorded (e.g. flight data\nrecorder), these data are not commonly shared. Acoordingly, a wide\nvariety of models have been developed to estimate fuel burn (and\nassociated emissions) for different applications. Applications range\nfrom global emission inventories to low-level analytics. The work within\nthese application fields is regularly challenged by the fact that\naircraft emission calculations require proprietary engine data which\nusually is difficult to obtain.\nThis work builds on openly available engine emission data. The goal\nis to build simple estimation model applicable for performance\nbenchmarking to keep calculation complexity reasonably low. The overall\naim it to develop an approach suitable for regional operational\nperformance comparisons. This apporach trades off complexity versus\naccuracy. Total emission estimates shall therefore be considered as\nrough point estimates.\nThe contribution of this paper are as follows:\ndevelopment of supporting material to estimate fuel burn / CO2\nemissions as part of the operational performance benchmarking\ndevelopment and application of a the approach to additional time in\nterminal airspace and surface movement phases (i.e. taxi-in and\ntaxi-out)\nBackground\nICAO GANP Key Performance\nIndicators\n\nprovide overview of GANP, KPIs zoom in on ASMA, taxi-in/taxi-out\n\nConceptual Approach\nOperational inefficiencies typically increase the aircraft flying\ntime (i.e. airborne and surface movement times) and , thus, engine\nrunning time.
