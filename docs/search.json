      "contents": "\nWelcome!\nThis is an exploratory project in support of the on-going\nBrazil-Europe Operational Performance Comparison. The aim is to develop\na data-driven approach based on the existing operational efficiency\nindicator methodologies.\nOverview\nAir transportation has grown over the past decades. Air traffic is\nprojected to recover from the unprecedented decrease in demand during\nthe COVID pandemic period, 2020-2021.\nAcross the globe, states have defined ambitious political goals to\naddress the impact of climate change. Accordingly, there is a higher\ninterest in monitoring/estimating the impact of operational\n(in)efficiency.\nOperational inefficiencies typically increase the aircraft flying\ntime (i.e. airborne and surface movement times) and , thus, engine\nrunning time. Engine time is directly linked to fuel burn and associated\nemissions and pollutants. In that respect, inefficiencies contribute to\nthe ditremental effect of excessive emissions to climate change.\nAircraft engines produce various types of emissions. These emissions\ninclude carbon dioxide CO2, water vapour H2O, nitrogen oxides nitrogen\noxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), sulfur\noxides (SOX), particulate matter (PM), and other trace compounds. About\n70 percent of aircraft emissions are CO2; followed by H2O atslightly\nless than 30% while the rest of the pollutant represent less than 1\npercent each [source]. CO2 and H2O form significant amount of GHG\nemissions that can trigger climate change while NOX, CO, HC, SOX and\nparticulate matter are always associated with air quality and\nsubsequently public health\nOperational performance benchmarking aims at understanding the\nsimilarities and differences of operational practices/concepts,\ntechnological enablers, and strategic and operational priorities in\ndifferent regions. The practice of operational performance benchmarking\nis well established through regular bi-regional (e.g. US/EU, BRA-EUR,\nCHN-EUR) or multi-regional (PWBG) comparison reports. These\nreports/groups build their joint work on harmonised practices and\njointly agreed methods. ICAO is promoting a performance-based approach\nand associated benchmarking. Through its Global Air Navigation Plan\n(GANP), ICAO proposes a set of performance indicators to measure\noperational performance. However, to date, this set of indicators does\nnot cater specifically for Environmental (Sustainability). As an initial\nstep, there is an intetest to develop tools/approaches for converting\noperational inefficiencies into additional fuel burn/\\(CO_2\\) emissions.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nTo measure operational inefficiencies, the ICAO GANP proposes a set\nof indicators:\nsurface movement phase: additional taxi-in and taxi-out time\napproach phase: additional time in terminal airspace\nThese indicators compare the observed (actual) movement duration,\ne.g. from off-block to take-off, with an associated reference time.\nReference times are calculated for flights with similar characteristics.\nFrom each sub-population the 20th percentile of the observed movement\ndurations is calculated as the reference time.\nNote: provide details to the algorithms.\nFrom an environmental perspective, fuel burn is directly linked to\nengine time. Accordingly, inefficiencies, i.e. additional times,\nrepresent excessive engine time (and associated fuel burn). Green-house\ngas emissions are a product of fuel burn. Thus estimating the fuel burn\nper flight phase or measured inefficiency allows to quantify the\nenvironmental impact.\nFuel burn estimation requires a mapping of engine and airframe. This\nmapping is further complicated by the fact that various aircraft of the\nsame family may be fitted with different engines. Accordingly, this work\nis not - yet - aiming to establish a “perfect” aircraft/engine mapping.\nThe associated mapping is based on representative engines (and based on\nopen data / resources).\nFuel Estimation\ntaxi at uniform thrust setting / velocity - associated fuel\nconsumption of aircraft \\(F_i\\) is as\nfollows: \\(F_i = T_i × f_i × N_i\\) Ti\nis the taxiing time of aircraft i, fi is the fuel flow of one aircraft\ni, and Ni is the number of engines in aircraft i\nThe calculation formula of pollutant k is as follows: \\(E_{ik} = T_i × f_i × N_i × EI_{ik}\\) where\nEik is the emissions of pollutant k of aircraft i during surface taxiing\nand EIik is the emission index of pollutant k from one engine of\naircraft i.\nThe following builds on the formulation of Zhang et al., 2019 (zhangAssessmentMethodFuel2019a?).\nFull-engine taxiing. Full-engine taxiing means that the main engines\nof aircraft are initiated and work at a uniform velocity during surface\ntaxiing. This taxiing mode is the most commonly used at present. Fuel\nconsumption (F E i ) of any aircraft i under full taxiing can be\nexpressed on the basis of differences in engine fuel flows under\ndifferent taxiing states: F E i = X j T E ij × Ni × fij × α,\nwhere j represents the engine states, namely, idling, uniform\nvelocity, breakaway, and turning; T E ij is the taxiing time of aircraft\ni under full-engine taxiing when the engine is at state j; Ni refers to\nthe number of engines in aircraft i; fij is the fuel flow of aircraft i\nwhen the engine is at state j; and α refers to the influencing\ncoefficient of low-visibility weather on taxiing time. Pollutant gas\nemissions of aircrafts are related to fuel consumption and states of the\ndynamic device. The emissions of pollutant k (E E ik) of aircraft i\nunder full-engine taxiing can be expressed as follows: E E ik = X j T E\nij × Ni × fij × α × EIijk, (9) where EIijk is the emission index of\npollutant k of the aircraft i when the engine is at state j. (2)\nSingle-engine taxiing. If frictional force and airport surface slope are\nallowed, then the aircraft can reserve one engine during taxiing. Under\nsingle-engine taxiing, the engine can only consume fuel and produce\npollutants during its operation. If single-engine taxiing is adopted,\nthen the main engine, which is closed, must be preheated before entering\ninto the runway. The main engine can provide take-off power to the\naircraft only after preheating. The engine start-up time (ESUT) is\nrelated to the aircraft mode, engine mode, and closed time of the\nengines. The duration is generally 2–5 min. Under taxiing, the aircraft\nneeds time to cool the engines, which are closed during taxiing, after\nit lands. The engine cool-down time is similar to ESUT. The fuel\nconsumption (F s i ) of any aircraft i under single taxiing can be\nexpressed as follows: F s i = X j T s ij × Ni 2 × fij × α + Ni 2 × f 0 i\n× min T s i × α, 5 , (10) where T s ij is the taxiing time of aircraft\ni under single-engine taxiing when the engine is at state j; Ni 2\nindicates aircraft taxiing when only half of the engines are started to\nproduce thrust; fij is the fuel flow of aircraft i when the engine is at\nstate j; f 0 i is the fuel flow under idling when preheating or cooling\nof engines is not needed during taxiing; min T s i × α, 5 indicates\nthat if the taxiing time of the aircraft is longer than 5 min, then the\npreheating or cooling time of engines is set to 5 min. If the taxiing\ntime is less than 5 min, then the preheating or cooling time of engines\nis used as the taxiing time. Under single-engine taxiing, emissions of\npollutant k (E s ik) can be expressed as follows: E s ik = X j T s ij ×\nNi 2 × fij × α × EIijk + Ni 2 × f 0 i × min T s i × α, 5 × EIik, (11)\nwhere EIijk is the emission index of pollutant k of aircraft i when the\nengine is at state j and EIik is the emission index of pollutant k when\nthe engine is at idling state. (3) External AGPS External AGPS is a\ntaxiing mode driven by a motor tractor while the main engine of the\naircraft is unused. When the tractor drags the aircraft to initiate\nsurface taxiing, engines remain at the idling state and are only started\n5 min before take-off. Later, the aircraft accomplishes taxiing in the\nlast taxiway section, and the tractor automatically returns. The\ntraction taxiing velocity of the aircraft is far smaller than that\ndriven by engines. The tractor can be divided into diesel- and\nelectric-driven types [36]. The latter is more economical and\nenvironmentally friendly than the former. However, comparing the\nelectricity with fuel consumption under other taxiing modes is\ndifficult. Therefore, the diesel-driven tractor was applied as an\nexternal AGPS in the present study. The fuel consumption (F t i ) of any\naircraft i during external AGPS in an airport can be expressed as\nfollows: F t i = Ti × BHP × LF × f t ij × α + Ni × f 0 i × min(Ti × α,\n5) (12) where Ti is the surface taxiing time of aircraft i under\nexternal AGPS. Brake horsepower (BHP) refers to the average rated BHP of\nan engine equipment type\nBenchmarking\nand Fuel Estimation in Arrival Phase\nuse ICAO Carbon Emission Calculator “data”\naerodrome pair estimation based on web-interface\nstage length based scaling\n\ndetermine “average” fuel burn for “average” flight during last\n100NM, and associate this fuel burn with the reference time\ncalculate\ntotal fuel burn during arrival phase\nexcessive fuel burn for additional time in terminal airspace\n\nBenchmarking\nand Fuel Estimation in Taxi-in and Taxi-Out Phase\n\nintroduce LTO and modelling assumptions –> “aircraft engine\nexhaust emissions … (Masiol and Harrison)”.\n\nICAO defined a default LTO cycle consisting of distinct phases:\ntakeoff, climb, approach, and taxi/ground idle. These phases are\ncharacterised with specified thrust levels and times-in-mode.\nFor our study we developed a lookup table for aircraft/representative\nengines and linked this to the ICAO Engine Databank (ICAO (n.d.)).\nFor taxi-in, we only apply the assumed 7% thrust setting of the\nEngine Databank. Note: this does not take into account reverse thrust\noperations to decelerate the aircraft during its landing roll.\nFor operational performance benchmarking the taxi-out measure is\ndetermined by deriving the taxi time as the difference between the\nactual off-block time (AOBT) and the actual take-off time (ATOT). This\nincludes the take-off roll. The ICAO LTO time-in-mode assume a 0.7min\n(=42 sec) take-off roll. From an operational perspective this is a\nreasonable assumption for the majority of commercial aircraft.\nNote: The take-off roll assumption needs to be adapted for piston and\nprivate aircraft operations (e.g. C172).\n\n\n\nICAO. n.d. “ICAO Engine Emissions Databank.”\n\n\n\n\n",

Air transportation accounts for about 2-3% of annual CO2\nemissions, however, the total amount of CO2 emissions constantly\nincreased pre-COVID.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual emissions by commercial aircraft 2004-2021\n\n\n\nFig 1 shows the total emissions of commercial flights\nas reported by IATA (IATA\n2019).\nLevers for fuel reduction:\noperational efficiency\nmarket-based measures\nsustainable aviation fuel\nnew aircraft propulsion and airframes\nA wider use and pick-up of sustainable aviation fuel, and new\naircraft propulsion technologies or aircraft design requires further\nresearch. Despite the introduction of an initial market-based mechanism,\nimmediate action to curb fuel burn and CO2 emissions rests with\nimprovements of operational efficiency.\nICAO promotes a performance-based approach. The Global Air Navigation\nPlan (GANP) proposes indicators for regional benchmarking (ICAO\n2019). However, there is no detailed guidance on how to\nmeasure additional fuel burn.\nFuel burn per se is known to the aircraft operator. While the actual\nfuel burn and fuel flow during the flight is recorded (e.g. flight data\nrecorder), these data are not commonly shared. Acoordingly, a wide\nvariety of models have been developed to estimate fuel burn (and\nassociated emissions) for different applications. Applications range\nfrom global emission inventories to low-level analytics. The work within\nthese application fields is regularly challenged by the fact that\naircraft emission calculations require proprietary engine data which\nusually is difficult to obtain.\nThis work builds on openly available engine emission data. The goal\nis to build simple estimation model applicable for performance\nbenchmarking to keep calculation complexity reasonably low. The overall\naim it to develop an approach suitable for regional operational\nperformance comparisons. This apporach trades off complexity versus\naccuracy. Total emission estimates shall therefore be considered as\nrough point estimates.\nThe contribution of this paper are as follows:\ndevelopment of supporting material to estimate fuel burn / CO2\nemissions as part of the operational performance benchmarking\ndevelopment and application of a the approach to additional time in\nterminal airspace and surface movement phases (i.e. taxi-in and\ntaxi-out)\nBackground\nICAO GANP Key Performance\nIndicators\n\nprovide overview of GANP, KPIs zoom in on ASMA, taxi-in/taxi-out\n\nConceptual Approach\nOperational inefficiencies typically increase the aircraft flying\ntime (i.e. airborne and surface movement times) and , thus, engine\nrunning time.
