To measure operational inefficiencies, the ICAO GANP proposes a set of indicators:

* surface movement phase: additional taxi-in and taxi-out time
* approach phase: additional time in terminal airspace

These indicators compare the observed (actual) movement duration, e.g. from off-block to take-off, with an associated reference time.
Reference times are calculated for flights with similar characteristics. 
From each sub-population the 20th percentile of the observed movement durations is calculated as the reference time.

Note: provide details to the algorithms.

From an environmental perspective, fuel burn is directly linked to engine time.
Accordingly, inefficiencies, i.e. additional times, represent excessive engine time (and associated fuel burn).
Green-house gas emissions are a product of fuel burn. 
Thus estimating the fuel burn per flight phase or measured inefficiency allows to quantify the environmental impact.

Fuel burn estimation requires a mapping of engine and airframe.
This mapping is further complicated by the fact that various aircraft of the same family may be fitted with different engines. 
Accordingly, this work is not - yet - aiming to establish a "perfect"  aircraft/engine mapping.
The associated mapping is based on representative engines (and based on open data / resources).

# Benchmarking and Fuel Estimation in Arrival Phase

* use ICAO Carbon Emission Calculator "data"
  + aerodrome pair estimation based on web-interface
  + stage length based scaling
* determine "average" fuel burn for "average" flight during last 100NM, and associate this fuel burn with the reference time
* calculate 
  + total fuel burn during arrival phase
  + excessive fuel burn for additional time in terminal airspace
  
# Benchmarking and Fuel Estimation in Taxi-in and Taxi-Out Phase

>introduce LTO and modelling assumptions --> "aircraft engine exhaust emissions ... (Masiol and Harrison)". 

For our study we developed a lookup table for aircraft/representative engines and linked this to the ICAO Engine Databank (@icao_engine_databank).

For taxi-in, we only apply the assumed 7% thrust setting of the Engine Databank.
Note: this does not take into account reverse thrust operations to decelerate the aircraft during its landing roll.

For operational performance benchmarking the taxi-out measure is determined by deriving the taxi time as the difference between the actual off-block time (AOBT) and the actual take-off time (ATOT).
This includes the take-off roll.
The ICAO LTO time-in-mode assume a 0.7min (=42 sec) take-off roll. 
From an operational perspective this is a reasonable assumption for the majority of commercial aircraft. 

Note: The take-off roll assumption needs to be adapted for piston and private aircraft operations (e.g. C172).
